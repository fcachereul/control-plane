# Overview

The OpenLISP control plane (opencp) repository https://github.com/lip6-phare/opencp hosts an open source control plane for LISP (the Location/Idenfitier Separation Protocol), a protocol designed at the IETF.
It is designed to work on both linux and BSD platforms.

This project is independant of the openlisp dataplane developed at https://github.com/lip6-lisp/openlisp and can work with other dataplanes such as lispmob or cisco's.

For a detailed presentation of the software architecture, pleave consult reference 1.
