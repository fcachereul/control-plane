**Require: expat library (need expat.h expat_external.h in /usr/local/include/)

1. Make sure that you have the gcc compiler.

2. Unpack the tarball soure code.

3. From source code directory, run 'make'. This will make binary file 'opencp'.

4. Still from source code directory, run 'make install' to install service script to /etc/rc.d/. 
It also copy the main configure file (opencp.conf) and 05 sample configures 
file 'opencp_xtr.xml, opencp_ms.xml, opencp_mr.xml, opencp_node.xml, opencp_rtr.xml' to /etc/. Please edit 
the configure files to suit before go to next step. The opencp_mr-sample-configure-of-ddt-root.xml file 
is an example of configuration for DDT root. The opencp_xtr-sample-configure-of-lisp-te.xml file is an examle
of configuration for rtr node.

5. To start the program at first time, use '/etc/rc.d/opencp_service start' command or run manual
by ./opencp [<path_to_opencp.conf>]

6. To make program auto start when reboot, edit the /etc/rc.conf and add the flow line:
	opencp_service_enable="YES"
