3. From source code directory, run 'make'. This will make binary file 'opencp'.

4. Still from source code directory, run 'make install' to install service script to /etc/init.d/. 
It also copy the main configure file (opencp.conf) and 05 sample configures 
file 'opencp_xtr.xml, opencp_ms.xml, opencp_mr.xml, opencp_node.xml, opencp_rtr.xml' to /etc/. Please edit 
the configure files to suit before go to next step. The opencp_mr-sample-configure-of-ddt-root.xml file 
is an example of configuration for DDT root. The opencp_xtr-sample-configure-of-lisp-te.xml file is an examle
of configuration for rtr node.
